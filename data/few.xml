                <p>from it: then in the dealings of princes and<lb/>
                    statesmen with each other there is generosity nor<lb/>
                    pique, clear-sightedness nor confusedness: that<lb/>
                    interest which has so absolute a dominance over<lb/>
                    their affections has no sway at all upon<lb/>
                    their judgments: that [<del>they</del> the agents <add>trustees</add> of rival<lb/>
                    nations] they are constantly of the same mind<lb/>
                    at bottom about the meaning of every word<lb/>
                    that comes before them: that within each man's<lb/>
                    breast words however ambiguous and words however<lb/>
                    clear would be sure of receiving the same<lb/>
                    construction: that the binding power of the latter<lb/>
                    <add>is</add> would in no case <add>ever</add> be greater than that of the<lb/>
                    former: and that a sovereign <add>neither the minister of a King with the <add><gap/> of an individual</add></add> would in our<lb/>
                    case be either more ashamed or more afraid<lb/>

                <p>There are errors which men are led into sometimes<lb/>
